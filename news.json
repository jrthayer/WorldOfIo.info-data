If you get a random message from someone - with a general \"Hey how are you?\" and you've never interacted with this person (or interacted with them superficially on discords with passing hellos), check their profile.  If they are advertising that they are an artist, or that they have commission slot opens, more than likely they are attempting to scam you into commissions.\n\n2. Do not engage.  These scam artists message a ton of people, and won't go any further if you do not respond, but if they do and you're feeling harassed, message a mod with a screenshot."
